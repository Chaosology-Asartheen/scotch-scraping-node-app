# scotch-scraping-node-app
Simple app for scraping author profiles from [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io). This app is based on [scotch-scraping-node](https://github.com/gladchinda/scotch-scraping-node) project and adds a client-side view to enable searching authors and listing posts. You can test the live **Hello Scotch** app on Heroku: [https://hello-scotch-node.herokuapp.com](https://hello-scotch-node.herokuapp.com).
<br/><br/>

If you intend to hack the source code and extend it to suite your needs you can refer to the **README** at [scotch-scraping-node](https://github.com/gladchinda/scotch-scraping-node/blob/master/README.md) to get started.
